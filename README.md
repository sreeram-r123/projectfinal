ðŸŒ¿ AQI Prediction Web App (Streamlit)
This Python code creates a web-based AQI (Air Quality Index) prediction app using Streamlit. It loads a trained regression model (project_model.pkl) to predict AQI based on user inputs for various atmospheric gas levels and environmental conditions (like SOâ‚‚, CO, NO, NHâ‚ƒ, temperature, wind, etc.).
